                    and unrealistic advertising.<br>
                    Why is menstruation still taboo
                    in 2021?

                <p class="p3">
                    Menstruation has always been seen as a sign of<br>
                    women’s fertility. Although every woman experience<br>
                    it monthly during whole decades, many still<br>
                    feel embarrassed when they are menstruating.<br>
                    How did we become used to not talking about it?<br>
                    Or even worse, to trying to hide it? It is therefore<br>
                    best time to stop feeling ashamed of this biological<br>
                    function and to stop the stigma that still annoys us.<br>
                </p>

                <h5>What did they teach us?</h5>

                <p class="p4">
                    Menstruation became after many years taboo in<br>
                    almost every field. Even names, such as “period”,<br>
                    “the time of the month” or “my days”, have been<br>
                    invented to hide the meaning of disgrace. Menstruation<br>
                    was in old days associated with impurity, dirt and<br>
                    fear of losing virginity. And as our ancestors,<br>
                    teachers and sometimes even relatives taught us,<br>
                    that is the worst sin that may ever happen to a<br>
                    woman. Or at least before marriage…<br>

                    "After lesson<br>
                    we got instructions<br>
                    not to talk about it <br>
                    with boys."
                </aside>

                <h6>I remember how awkward it was<br>
                    in school
                </h6>

                <p class="p5">
                    First, they separated us from boys saying they<br>
                    will learn about something “boyish” instead.<br>
                    Woman, who came to talk to us about sex edu-<br>
                    cation, started with whispering as if it was<br>
                    something prohibited. The atmosphere in the<br>
                    class was serious and tense. After lesson we got<br>
                    instructions not to talk about it with boys.<br>
                    Maybe if we would openly talk about menstruation<br>
                    from childhood, men wouldn’t be that scared and<br>
                    anxious about it in adulthood.
