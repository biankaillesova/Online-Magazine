                        Menstruation has always been seen as a sign of<br>
                        women’s fertility. Although every woman experience<br>
                        it monthly during whole decades, many still<br>
                        feel embarrassed when they are menstruating.<br>
                        How did we become used to not talking about it?<br>
                        Or even worse, to trying to hide it? It is therefore<br>
                        best time to stop feeling ashamed of this biological<br>
                        function and to stop the stigma that still annoys us.<br>

                    <p class="p4">
                        Menstruation became after many years taboo in<br>
                        almost every field. Even names, such as “period”,<br>
                        “the time of the month” or “my days”, have been<br>
                        invented to hide the meaning of disgrace. Men-<br>
                        struation was in old days associated with impurity,<br>
                        dirt and fear of losing virginity. And as our ancestors,<br>
                        teachers and sometimes even relatives taught us,<br>
                        that is the worst sin that may ever happen to a<br>
                        woman. Or at least before marriage…<br>

                        Oh, that shame when you wore your new white<br>
                        jeans and suddenly you had to wrap your<br>
                        hoodie around. And that moment when you<br>
                        had to ask your friend “for a help” in front of the<br>
                        whole class? What about endless washing of<br>
                        blood stains when none of the detergents in<br>
                        your bathroom works? You already washed it<br>
                        work on the third time! And how we’re all trying<br>
                        not to “swoosh” while opening the covers on the toilet.

                        First, they separated us from boys saying they<br>
                        will learn about something “boyish” instead.<br>
                        Woman, who came to talk to us about sex edu-<br>
                        cation, started with whispering as if it was<br>
                        something prohibited. The atmosphere in the<br>
                        class was serious and tense. After lesson we got<br>
                        instructions not to talk about it with boys.<br>
                        Maybe if we would openly talk about menstruation<br>
                        from childhood, men wouldn’t be that scared and<br>
                        anxious about it in adulthood.
